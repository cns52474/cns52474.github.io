Welcome to My Page!</div>
<p>Hello! I am Caroline Nicole Sweat, a freshman here at UGA! I grew up in Wrightsville, Georgia and attended Brentwood School from Kindergarten until twelfth grade.
At UGA, my biggest class is 300 people. In high school, my entire graduating class included only 25 people. 
It has been difficult to transition from a small town like Wrightsville to Athens. I have always been extremely close with my family, so being away from them has been a challenge. Luckily, I got plugged into some amazing organizations and immediately felt at home here in Athens.</p>
<p>I am actively involved in Cru, a campus ministry here at UGA. I participate in retreats, socials, and sing with the praise brand regularly.
I am also a member of the sorority, Delta Delta Delta. I joined this sorority last semester and it has been one of the greatest decisions I have ever made for myself. Next year, I will have the opportunity to live in the sorority house with my five best friends: Joy, Abby, Gabby, Lily, and Emma.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that my two favorite things in this world are food and movies. I could go on and on about my favorite foods, but I will narrow it down to my favorite places to eat. 
<p>If I had to list my top three favorite places to eat, it would have to be...</p>
<OL>
<Li>Chick-fil-A</Li>
<Li> Zaxby's</Li>
<Li> Olive Garden</Li>
</OL>
<p> I also included a chart to show my favorite meals at these restaurants and my opinion of their quality of service.</p>
<div style="table-align:center"><TABLE BORDER=2>
<tr style="background-color:#F22E99"><th><B> Restaraunt</B></th><th><B>Fast food</B></th><th>Quickness</th><th> Favorite Meal </th></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#F22E99"><td> Chick-fil-A </td><td> Yes </td><td> Very efficient </td><td> Chicken Sandwich with Fries </td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#F22E99"><td> Zaxby's </td><td> Yes </td><td> Not as fast </td><td> Fried House Salad with Ranch Dressing </td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#F22E99"><td>Olive Garden </td><td> No </td><td> Slow </td><td> Cheese Ravioli </td></tr>

<p> I have always enjoyed watching 80s movies with my dad. One year for Christmas, my parents bought me an entire box of 80s movies because they know how much I enjoy them. If I had to pick my favorite 80s movie, I would definitely choose The Breakfast Club. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. </p>
